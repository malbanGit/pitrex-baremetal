Changelog:

7th of May 2021

    added GS BASIC (https://vectrex32.com/)
    BASIC starts in the directory “/basic” – since no directory changes can be done from BASIC, this is the BASIC “home”
    gsbasic.ini for some “option”, more information in the file:
    GS_BASIC.txtm OtherTitle.txt VXTRON.txt

    in s slightly modified version
    added support of USB keyboards (see source code distribution: usb_readme.txt)
    I started the USB keyboard thing, because I wanted to control “Elite a new Kind” via keyboard, rather than invent tricky button double/tripple usages.
    Elite a new Kind is as of now only included as a “demo” version (start screen), since GS BASIC came along an stole my time 🙂 – actually the whole game is compiled, but I haven’t configured the keyboard in, and didn’t look at/fix any of the non vector gfx yet
    I started porting the MAME z80 processor emulation to be used in AAE, it compiles now without flaws, but I have as yet not changed the API to fit AAE. Once I have done, almost all SEGA games should work.
    I am also thinking about (as a quick hack) to add USB keyboard to AAE, than the default keyboard
    settings should work for all games out of the box, and they would be playable via keyboard – not optimal, but better than “waiting” to manually configuring each and every game to the vectrex controls
    Asteroids (sbt) can now in the ini file be configured to use/not use samples
    during the above changes… some bugs were discovered and fixed in the vectrexInterface, can’t remember them all
    osWrapper.c is “wrappier” than before 🙂 e.g. if keyboard is configured you can use fgetc() to “wait” for keyboard input
    vectrexInterface can be configured to use two sample channels, these will be mixed. Default this is “off” – but it DOES work!
    started looking at bitmaps again, one of the next things will be to add bitmap output to the IRQMode (as of now, this os not yet supported)
    changed the “structure” of the baremetal directories, vectrexInterface (and others) are now build as libraries, not several object files. All Makefiles were changed (slightly)
    I like it, when include files are kept WITH their respective sources, so I did not create a dedicated include directory, the "INC_DIR" must be set in the makefiles to the correct locations
    GS BASIC is written in c++, thus c++ is now supported to be built.
    As an example look at GS BASIC. For now, the global/static constructors must be called “manually” in the main() function (6 lines of code), if you intend to program c++, these lines must be copied!
    added emulation of the TMS5220 to sample out (Star Wars), although since star wars is to slow, the output is rather choppy

12th of April 2021

    added the possibilty to play samples alongside vectordisplay
    (digitized sound will be barely audiable on noBuzz vectrex – there is nothing I can do about it!)
    added for asteroids 2 samples (explosions)
    tweaked battlezone, for “english” settings output might be smoother than before (other languages not supported yet)
    added “1 joystick mode” for battlezone, this is the new default
    for battlezone added dipswitches
    for battlezone highscore saving/loading added
    added sound to battlezone (except the engine sound)
    added the start of AAE emulation the aae emulator can be access from the menu (last arcade emulator)
    then you can chose which game to “play”
    loadable and with “input”: Star Wars (6809) and Major Havoc (6502), but I have not really tried optimizing them – and one can see that!
    Cinematronics games (ccpu) are loadable as well, but I have not configured input
    I forgott to switch IRQ mode on for the AAE emulator, so if configured right, there would be a probably more than 20% speed increase
    I am still waiting on feedback in relation to the Z80 CPU. Once I get a working copy, probably all SEGA games can be supported as well.
    AAE roms are not included – and I don’t know what version you need, but “clues” can be found in the readme in the ROM directory
    many tweaks to the vectrexInterface…

26th of March 2021

    default calibration is back to zero, on the todo list -> calibration for noBuzz vectrex
    added configuration (ini file) for input settings, as of now asteroids only, look at the ini file
    added dipswitch settings (ini file), as of now asteroids only, look at ini file, in game these can be called with button 1+4 on joypad 1
    fixed asteroids output to accomodate the 4 different languages
    fixed a “calibration 0” bug with in the vectrex library, y pos could be always “0” after calibration (visible with asteroids shots)
    fixed “speedy vectrex” raster output
    added ini setting “IN_GAME_SETTINGS” which enables or disables Button 2 of Joypad 2 to invoke settings menu. Per default this is OFF
    vectrex save state, if enabled (ini setting HANDLE_STATES), it asks you whether to save or not, also shows a “SAVING…”.
    Saving seems to take sometimes up to 18 seconds (with my SD cart, less than a second…)

I have to further evaluate the “speed”.
I have measured the piZero speed, and as far as I can measure:
1 Mhz timer is pretty exact
Cycle timer is pretty exact
Vectrex T2 timer is pretty exact
The reason I mention this… although “programmatically” and reports during game support this… the games are running all at the correct speed.
However …

    if I compare the games with MAME or the VecFever – it seems they are to slow
    Kevin mentioned ZBlast as being to slow
    the sample tests… seem output of the samples are to slow

I am at a loss what may cause that. As said timing measurements are correct – somehow I must be doing something wrong here… 
but measuring speed with several timers, is not really THAT complicated, that one would easily mess it up…

24th of March 2021

    IRQ mode implemented, vectrex output about 20% faster
    if you are a PiTrex baremetal programmer, contact me, to get notified of changes you have to be aware of!
    game update frequency is disjunct from the vectrex display frequency
    asteroids now has a “hyperjump” button
    asteroids saves / loads highscores
    XSH delay is now correctly implemented, that should “correct” the last seen screen garbles on some vectrex

15th of March 2021

    removed all settings files
    removed all “old” ini files
    the “main” ini file is now vectrexInterface.ini
    Settings can be changed from the menu, if reached via the menu, the settings will be saved to sd drive
    settings “in game” can be called by pressing button 2 of joystick 2, these will be active but not saved (yet)
    games/ emulators can still have own ini files, but I did not create default ones
    all games/emulators have now sensible default values to start with
    Settings are now applied in following order
    a) Settings from vectrexInterface.ini
    b) default settings inside the emulator
    c) Settings from the emulator specific ini file
    Navigation within the “settings”:
    Joystick port one:
    UP/DOWN – change configuration item
    LEFT/RIGHT – change the settings for the current item
    Button 1 – show help for the current selected item
    Button 2 – change the shown vector list
    Button 4 – exit (and save)
    Button 2+3 together – reset current configuration item to default settings
    Button 3+Joystick – move vector list
    Button 2+Joystick LEFT/RIGHT – change settings value in larger steps
    vectorblade bugfix (emulation, not vector blade)
    added config to battle zone (see battlezone.ini)
    corrected after “calibration” weirdness
    corrected “after dot move”
    added config to leave dots in there list position
    added clipping to some emulators
    changed the intro + “bouncing PiTrex”

11th of March 2021

    added additional logging on save state of vectrex – pls test that again and send me the output
    additionally on vectrex Joypad 2- button 1 saves the state, Button 4 loads the state.
    Does this also crash? – Pls report back!
    the pipeline “timing” in vectrex interface was changed from using the pi TIMER to using the pi cycle timer, which is much more exact (100 times!). Thus internally seemingly a lot changed!
    I spent much time with improving asteroids.
    The display should be much more stable. The Asteroids should move much smoother!
    The display should not shake or wobble (as much) when a UFO appears, bright shots are fired or the “PUSH START” appears. Still left to do: speed up (so the game over text appears flicker free), save highscores.
    This – although it cannot really be seen – proved to be not really “simple” – but this also layed the ground work for improving other emulators. We now have the ability to identify vector clusters and react to them “outside” of the emulation. As a showcase for that, you can configure in the ini file whether you want to see the atari copyright in game or not.
    added the before only on raspbian available game “ZBLAST”, including high score save, sound and background music. The music was given to me by Roald Strauss, who also has a website (IndieGameMusic.com), where he offers free – and royalty based – music scores of different kinds. From chip tunes and mod files to MP3. Thank you!
    added the before only on raspbian available game “Hyperoids”, including sound.
    both additions would not have been possible without the vectrexInterface / svgalib interface programmed by Kevin Koster. Using his base it was a matter of a couple of hours to support these two games.
    added several “icons” to the menu.

02nd of March 2021

    I have completed the dumb/stupid/boring task, to change ALL needed arcade emulation roms to MAME compatible roms (I tested loading with MAME roms 201 and 229, so “everything” newer than 2 years old should work)
    also supported are ZIP files, thus – just copying MAME roms to the “roms” folder is enough to get started with arcade emulations
    This means to run arcade emulation, you MUST provide new zip/rom files!
    I have added all “current” emulators that appear to at least run a little bit. I have not found many “cinematronics” emulations that run really well.
    best is probably tailgunner, starhawk, barrier…
    also added all “sim” emulators most of them boot up and are actually playable – although without sound
    I am astonished, that the “sim” asteroids emulation actually crashes after a while… there must still be something wrong in the 6502 emulation core… (the roms are identical to to sbt version)
    “icons” for those are missing… I have to get some more podcast to star drawing again… this will be put off for a time
    all emulators support now “ini” files, these can also be specific for each emulated rom
    I added a new option to the ini file “LOG_OUTPUT=1; if different than 0 – than log all “printf” outputs also to SD”, once you can test the new version and the
    screen still goes black upon returning – I hope the captured output can help me identify the problem 
    for the “atari”/sim emulators I added “sensible” ini files
